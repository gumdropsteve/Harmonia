### Using the Testnets
#### What is a testnet?
TLDR: building on blockchain for free.
> Since Ethereum is a protocol, this means there can be multiple independent "[networks](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks)" conforming to this protocol that do not interact with each other.
> 
> Mainnet is the primary public Ethereum production blockchain, where actual-value transactions occur on the distributed ledger.
> When people and exchanges discuss ETH prices, they're talking about mainnet ETH.
> 
>  In addition to mainnet, there are public [testnets](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks/#testnets). These are networks used by protocol developers or smart contract developers to test both protocol upgrades as well as potential smart contracts in a production-like environment before deployment to mainnet. Think of this as an analog to production versus staging servers. - [Etherium docs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks/)
